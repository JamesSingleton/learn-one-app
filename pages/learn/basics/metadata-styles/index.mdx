}

Both the first route we added as well as the second (child) module we added currently do not have any styling. Let's add some CSS to style them.

Since CSS is global, One App uses the [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) pattern to avoid class name collisions.

### What You’ll Learn in This Lesson

In this lesson, you'll learn:

- How to add global CSS to your `root-module`.
- How to implement CSS Modules within your modules.
- How to customize what goes inside the `<head>` using [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
