Let’s now talk about **CSS styling**.

As you can see, our index page ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) doesn't have any styles.

### Writing and Importing CSS

One App has built-in support for Sass which allows you to import `.scss` files.

In this lesson, we’ll talk about how to write and import SCSS files in One App.

### Adding CSS

Now, let's add some styles to our `one-app-child-module`. To do so, we'll use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), which lets you import CSS files in a React component.

Create a file called `OneAppChildModule.scss` in the `components` directory with the following content:

```css
.main {
  max-width: 36rem;
  padding: 0 1rem;
  margin: 3rem auto 6rem;
}
```

To use this in `OneAppChildModule.jsx`, you need to:

- Import it as `styles`
- Use `styles.<class-name>` as `className`
- In this case, the class name is `main`, so we'll use `styles.main`

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
