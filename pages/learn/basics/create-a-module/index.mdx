To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to localize your application.

### One App: A fresh, modular take

One App provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it allows you and your team to successfully build a scalable React application.
