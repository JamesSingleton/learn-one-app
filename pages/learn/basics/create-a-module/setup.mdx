First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you don’t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You’ll need Node.js version **12.0.0** or later.
- If you don't have **Docker** installed, [install it from here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.

> If you are on Windows, we recommend [downloading Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial.

### Create a One App Module

To create a One App Module, open your terminal, `cd` into the directory you’d like to create your module in, and run the following command:

```shell
npx -p yo -p @americanexpress/generator-one-app-module -- yo @americanexpress/one-app-module
```

Answer the prompts with the following answers:

1. What is the name of your module: `one-app-root`
2. Is this a root module or a child module: `root-module`
3. Generate with Parrot Middleware: `no` (more on this later)
4. Set up with internationalization: `no` (more on this later)

> Under the hood, this uses a tool called `yeoman`, which is used to bootstrap either a root module or a child module.

### Run the development server

You now have a new directory called `one-app-root`. Let’s `cd` into it:

```shell
cd one-app-root
```

Then, run the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This starts your One App "development server" (more on this later) on port **3000**.

Let’s check to see if it’s working. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) from your browser.

**Question**: What text do you see on the page?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
