  title: 'Create a One App Module',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'create-a-module',
  stepId: 'editing-the-module',
  subtitle: 'Editing the module'
}

Let's try editing the starter page.

- Run `npm run watch:build`.
- Restart `one-app-runner` by running `npm start` in a separate terminal.
- Open `src/components/OneAppRoot.jsx` with your text editor.
- Find the text that says **"Welcome to"** under the `<h1>` tag and change it to **"Learn"**.
- Save the file.

As soon as you save the file, refresh the browser to see the new text:

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Learn Next.js"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/create-a-module/learn-one-app.png"
  width={600 / 2}
  height={170 / 2}
/>
