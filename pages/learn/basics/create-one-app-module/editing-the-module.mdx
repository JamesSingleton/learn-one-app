import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'
import Image from '../../../../components/image'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Create a Next.js App',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'create-nextjs-app',
  stepId: 'editing-the-page',
  subtitle: 'Editing the page'
}

Let’s try editing the starter page.

- Make sure the Next.js development server is still running.
- Open `pages/index.js` with your text editor.
- Find the text that says **“Welcome to”** under the `<h1>` tag and change it to **“Learn”**.
- Save the file.

As soon as you save the file, the browser automatically reloads and updates the page with the new text:

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Learn Next.js"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/create-nextjs-app/learn-nextjs.png"
  width={1030 / 2}
  height={384 / 2}
/>

The Next.js development server has the **Hot Reloading** feature. When you make changes to files Next.js automatically applies the changes in the browser. No refresh needed! This will help you iterate on your app quickly.

### Next Up: Creating Pages

Great job! That’s it for the first lesson.

In the next lesson, we’ll talk about _creating more pages and navigating between pages_.

> You should keep the development server running, but if you want to restart it, hit <kbd>Ctrl + c</kbd> to stop the server.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
