To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A _framework_ can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

### One App: A fresh, modular take

One App provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

One App has the best-in-class "Developer Experience" and many built-in features; a sample of them are:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment which supports Hot Module Replacement
- API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable

### About This Tutorial

This free interactive course will guide you through how to get started with One App.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn One App basics by creating a very simple **blog app**. Here’s an example of the final result:

Let’s get started!

> This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of JavaScript and React. If you’ve never written React code, you should go through [the official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) first.
