}

So far, the Next.js app we created only has one page. In general websites and web applications could have many different pages.

Let's explore how to add more pages to our application.

## What You’ll Learn in This Lesson

In this lesson, you will:

- Create a new page using the file system routing feature.
- Learn how to use the `Link` component to enable client-side navigation between pages.
- Learn about built-in support for code splitting and prefetching.

> If you’re looking for detailed documentation on Next.js routing, take a look at the <Link href="/docs/[[...slug]]" as="/docs/routing/introduction"><a>routing documentation</a></Link>.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
