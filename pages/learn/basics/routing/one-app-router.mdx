import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'

}

One App uses [@americanexpress/one-app-router](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app-router), a fork of [react-router@3](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3) uplifted to work with React@^17, for its client and server side routing.

### Create a New Route

First lets create a component under the components folder called `first-route.jsx` with the following contents:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default function FirstRoute() {
  return <h1>First Route</h1>
}
```

Now lets open your `childRoutes.jsx` and update it with the following contents:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Route } from '@americanexpress/one-app-router'
import FirstRoute from './components/FirstRoute'

const childRoutes = () => [<Route path="/first-route" component={FirstRoute} />]

export default childRoutes
```

Now lets open your `OneAppRoot.jsx` and update it with the following contents:

```jsx
const OneAppRoot = ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>
```

Now, make sure that the development server is running and visit [http://localhost:3000/first-route](http://localhost:3000/first-route). You should see the page:

<Image
  shadow
  alt="First Post"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/routing/first-route.png"
  width={516 / 2}
  height={213 / 2}
/>

This is how you can create different pages in One App.

Simply create a JSX file and add it to your `childRoutes.jsx`.

In a way, this is similar to building websites using HTML or PHP files. Instead of writing HTML you write JSX and use React Components.

Now lets see how to route between two different modules.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
